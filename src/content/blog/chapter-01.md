3:00 A.M

The phone screen nearly blinds me as I glare at the device. I let out a groan while thrashing around on the bed. I gave up and just laid there looking at the ceiling. The scenes from the nightmare played on the ceiling like a broken projector, each flickering image of her dripping blood on my face.

The void gazed at my soul, bruising the insides to mock my misery. They make garlands from the withered flowers of forget-me-not. As excruciating as it could be, she walked in and out as she pleased. Inflicting wounds as art in her nails, she adorned her lips with the blood she reaped.

I closed my eyes, praying for the murky torment to wash away from my vision. It felt like ages before I regained my composure from the ordeal. It’s not frequent that I experience nightmares, but when I do, it always leaves me numb for an hour or so. I wondered when was the last time I had thought of ‘her’.

Amidst the lingering unease, I heard shuffling noises near the bed. A white fluffy tail came into view, and I smiled as Hikari, my cloud dog, climbed up beside me. He showered me with happy, concerned licks. Basking in his warmth, I could feel my tensed body starting to relax. I petted him and nuzzled against his fur while Hikari was doing his small delightful dance.

“You’re my good boy” I cooed at him and was rewarded with cute licks all over my face. I kept caressing his fur and giving light scratches, while he just lay on the bed beside me.

Hikari and Cloud have been such good children that it baffles me to think how these creatures treat us. There seemed hope for broken people like us to love and to be loved but to be understood, that would be a different story.

I checked the time again and realized that she should be back from the hospital. I mentally apologized for the poor dinner she would need to eat.
