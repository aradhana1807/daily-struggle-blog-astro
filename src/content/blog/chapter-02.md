*It's suffocating.*

The air in the room got heavier each second with tension. The smell of blood and medicines infiltrated my olfactory senses. I should have been used to this by now but those remnants just won't leave me alone. I might be exaggerating but I can feel it burning holes in my lungs sometimes.

My professor watched as I cut through the skin over the thoracic cage. I was supposed to observe and remember how it's done but here I was trying hard not to let my mental monologue invade my primary job and focus on the present. I have done this a hundred times but never has the scalpel felt less heavier because of experience.

Was scalpel always this heavy? I have lost count of the times I pondered about it.

*A dreadful weight bears upon the tool you hold to operate; the weight of a human's life.*

Professor was almost finished and my hands were finally free. I stared at the scalpels and scissors, the light above making them look pretty. An object at rest will always have its own beauty to marvel at, but when the meaning of its existence is in action, it's a different story to look upon.

In a few minutes, the task was completed. I headed off to my desk to organize the research papers that's been messily sprawled on the table. I looked at the dimly lit room that smelled of dust and disinfectant. I sighed as I sorted the papers and put all the relevant research papers in my file binder to review them after I reached home.

Now that I think of it, she must be asleep by now.

I gathered my stuff and locked the office to head out of the hospital. It was past 2 am already when I reached the door of a taxi I called.

After getting inside the taxi, my mind drifted off to the small world outside as I gently pressed my forehead on the window. Same old street , turns, buildings that I have grown used to, painted with the brilliance of streetlights at this late hour. It's a small happiness I guess to drown in this scenery that may turn into memories for me to hold onto.

Thoracic cage.

The thoracic cage forms the thorax portion of the body. It consists of the 12 pairs of ribs with their costal cartilages and the sternum. The ribs are anchored posteriorly to the 12 thoracic vertebrae. The thoracic cage protects the heart and lungs.

I really wished the thoracic cage didn't just have physical significance. A certain weight the heart holds, makes me wonder how it's more heavier than the bones surrounding it. And there goes my brain trying to pull out an antithesis card against the anatomy of the thoracic cage.

As I saw the familiar neighborhood, I halted my antithesis conference for now. The taxi pulled over and I made my way out after paying. I wondered if I should get something to eat but then I did receive a text from the corgi bear that she ordered the food so I just made my way to the elevator. I'm already tired anyway so I wouldn't have taken any efforts to fill my tummy so yeah home it is then.

As I heard the elevator ding on the third floor, I immediately made my way home and didn't even bother knocking since I know that bear is already asleep. I took out the keys and unlocked the door. After getting inside, I took out my shoes and placed my coat on the hanger near the entrance. I looked around the hallway, finding only the dining room lights on.

Yeah, definitely asleep.

I switched on the lamp in the living room and plopped the file binder on the table. I felt about 10 years of my lifespan getting sucked out. I sighed and went to freshen up. A bath is all I need to get rid of this sticky sweat and smell of disinfectant.

After a soothing bath, I slipped onto my comfortable attire. The way to go is an oversized buttoned up shirt and shorts. As long as the comfort is not compromised, they will be added to the cart and swiped.

Now my gastric juice may invade anytime, so I went to the kitchen. I found a messily written sticky note on the fridge saying

> Today’s special menu is Pizza, so make sure to heat it up.

I'm pretty sure she was tired so didn't give it much thought to what to eat. I just chuckled and found the pizza inside the fridge. After reheating it, I headed off to the living room and switched on the TV just for the time being while I had my luxury dinner.

After finishing it up, I did the dishes and went back to review a few reports for the next shift. Then I started to review the papers that I have been going through for a week. Well, you'll be spending a lot of time reviewing as an apprentice. I felt a soft nudge against my leg. I bent down and smiled softly seeing who was responsible for that. I chuckled as the feline kept on clinging to my leg. I gently caressed Cloud's mighty fur and almost felt the tiredness fly away as I heard a satisfied purr. I scooped the walking cloud into my arms and let him rest on my lap. I thought he was already sleeping but I guess he must have heard me or the smell of pizza? I didn’t see Hikari around, which I assumed would be in her room.

I occasionally ran my fingers through Cloud's fur as I kept reviewing the papers. A certain tranquility just filled into this place. No, it's always been there. It's just that my absence is longer because of a demanding job although I'm not complaining about it. Especially if it meant for me to come home and feel this warmth in a place where my feelings are not trampled, unheard and misunderstood; I will keep choosing this life.

But as I was soaking in this profound tranquility, I felt sudden chills running down my spine.

Yikes!

"Is someone talking about me or what? Huh? Ehh?" I murmured to no one in particular.

Cloud gave a lazy yawn and started snuggling up close to me. I could only smile at this adorable baby and give him his favorite chin rub; his satisfied purr was like a cute reward for me. I let him sleep on my lap as I continued to go through my professor's journals.

But, who was even talking about me?

I shrugged it off and just made myself comfortable in this small world I have grown used to and would never trade it for anything. I didn't notice when I fell asleep on the couch. I may have gotten way too comfortable and cozy.

"Wake up, zombie", I heard someone calling me.

I barely could open my eyes since I still wanted more sleep. Then I felt a hand shaking me to wake up. But still I couldn't wake up since I slept like a log. The only force that jolted me to sit straight was the big wolf pup plopping on me and licking the heck out of my face.

"Okay, okay I'm awake", I lazily yawned and looked down to see the adorable wolf trying to get headpats. I lazily patted his head and he happily returned me his cute licks on my palm. I looked around to see the bear already on her way to make coffee.

"Good morning, zombie" I heard her say. I chuckled at the name I have been bestowed.

"Well , good morning" I stretched a bit and found the pets playing around. How I wish I had the energy to wake up like this. I thought while making a beeline to the bathroom.

"Now now, don't start getting jealous about how active these kids are" I heard an amused voice speaking from the kitchen.

"So what's for breakfast?" I asked as I rummaged for the toothbrush.

"Hmm." I heard a short reply. She's thinking about breakfast very hard. I just let her be as I just focus on becoming like a normal human; that is brushing and washing my face, the first step of revival from zombies.

After all the exorcism, I finally looked like a human (finally). I went to the dining table to sit but I felt a hand stopping me from dragging the chair out.

"Eh?"

"Cook. Breakfast" She deadpanned.

Wait a minute. I was supposed to cook? What ? Did I miss something?

"No stupid. I'm lazy so you cook" She replied as if she read my mind

This kid.

"I'll cook but you take out the huge dam inside your mind later" I sighed as I made my way to the kitchen. I heard a small hum in response to it.

This kid seriously.
